# pipeline_processor_verilog
RISC-V pipeline processor with verilog

I aimed to implement all 32-bit integer instruction sets of risc-v.

Especially, this time, I designed focusing on the data forwarding and hazard detection.

The execution of the branch instruction's execution is performed on EX stage.
